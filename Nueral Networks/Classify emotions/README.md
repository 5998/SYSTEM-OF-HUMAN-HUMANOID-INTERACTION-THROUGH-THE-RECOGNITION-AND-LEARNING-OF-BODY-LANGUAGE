# Artificial Neural Network which to classify the emotions using data from body posture.

This script was developed to create, train and test an artificial neural network which classify the mood of one person using like input 
a vector that containing 23 angles, each angle descrive the orientation of a specific joint of the body. 

This script was developed using PYTHON 3.6 (64 bits) in WINDOWS 10 and the following wrappers.

- keras version 2.0.6
- Tensorflow version 1.2.1 (keras backend engine)
- pandas version 0.19.2
- numpy version 1.11.3
- matplotlib version 2.0.0
- sklearn version 0.18.2
- csv version 1.0.0

The first step is create a data base with the tool [DataBaseCreatorHumanPosture.py](https://github.com/Ing-Mk-FranJa07/SYSTEM-OF-HUMAN-HUMANID-INTERACTION-THROUGH-THE-RECOGNITION-AND-LEARNING-OF-BODY-LANGUAGE/tree/master/Emotions%20Data%20Base%20Creator)

This tool generate a .csv file in which is saved a matrix that containing 25 joints angles and the description of the emotion that is 
being represented.
