### Introduction:

The humanoid robots have begun to be used in applications of accompaniment to humans in the execution of daily activities, such as assistance to the sick and the elderly; in education to increase the interest of learning from schools, and services of "hostess" in hotels, shopping centers, airports, restaurants, etc. And even as physical communication media (telepresence) in office environments capable of interacting with the environment around them, controlled by a user remotely, imitating the movements of the latter.

All the diverse applications to which the humanoid robots are being focused, have in common the continuous interaction with the humans, therefore, the emerging robots must be friendly to the human being in the sense that it is necessary to generate trust and acceptance by part of humans; most developed humanoids are not able to imitate or perceive any human emotion because people in general perceive them as "socially inept and of little confidence" and this is because the humans depends on emotions and of body language to make a communication of trust and interact with their peers.

A solution to improve human-humanoid interaction is through body language and the development of "artificial emotions", which has led to the development of social robotics and cognitive robotics, which seek social robots that "know what they do" Through learning in dynamic environments and interaction through effective and real communication with human beings.

Recently, social robots such as Pepper, created by Aldebaran Robotics and Softbank Mobile, have been developed. It has an emotional motor that allows it to study the gestures and the face of the person who interacts with it. Starting from the base created in Pepper, the propose is to develop a system that besides recognizing body gestures, can reproduce them or generate iy own gestures that send the desired message, generating artificial emotions, in order to increase the confidence and acceptance on the part of the beings humans.

### Objectives:

***General:*** 

Develop a functional system of recognition and learning of body language, through the programming of the humanoid robot Pepper, by means of the implementation of automatic learning algorithms, to improve human-humanoid interaction.

***Specifics:***

* Digitize, using the Kinect camera, real-time images of the movement related to the limbs of a person, obtaining the orientation of each of the joints of interest.
 
* Identify the corporal expressions that the robot can and can not perform, in order to develop postures that allow transmitting messages through body language and are easily identified and accepted by human beings.

* Implement an algorithm based on automatic learning through which human emotions and spoken messages are associated with the developed body language postures.

* Program the Pepper robot, applying the automatic learning algorithm, so that it recognizes certain emotions of human beings and identifies some topics of conversation, in order to make sequences of movement coherent with these stimuli, during the interaction with the human being.

### Justification:

At present, there has been a growing interest in the research and development areas of humanoid robots within the framework of social robotics and cognitive robotics, whose objective is focused on the study of robots capable of interacting and communicating with humans and environment. For this reason, this project focuses on the development of a system that allows complementing and improving the interaction between humans and humanoid robots, through the integration of body language in the effective communication process, in order that robots express their own gestures, which can mean emotions for the human beings with whom they interact.

It is really important that systems are developed and integrated into the humanoid robots that together with the advances in object recognition and navigation systems, with which they interact with the environment and make effective displacements in space, motivate a more natural interaction and of trust with humans for whom the gestural expression of emotions in communication and social interaction is fundamental; According to various studies, humans create empathy through the sensitivity provided by direct and indirect signals (verbal and non-verbal) that increase comfort and safety when facing, or in contact with, people day by day. It is expected that humanoid robots take on roles such as the nursing of people of great weight, therapeutic assistants, firefighters robots, babysitters, flight attendants, waiters or social workers with capacity to load and transport packages or merchandise; and even as companions of people during periods of solitude.

Around the world, various companies, research centers and universities are making advances in robotics-oriented research and the application of artificial intelligence strategies and algorithms for social purposes; Through this project the Autonoma de Occidente University in conjunction with "Haute Ecole d'Ing'enierie et de Gestion du Canton de Vaud" (HEIG-VD), through cooperation between teachers and students of both institutions, will be able to expand their lines and research nurseries and will give way to a range of new research opportunities for different students, who will be able to enjoy enriching life experiences through the modality of student exchanges, contributing to the integral formation from the academy, research and know new cultures and approaches to engineering thinking.
